## Graceful Degradation and Service Workers

Graceful degradation and service workers are connected because both help websites work well even when things go wrong.
Service workers follow the idea of graceful degradation. They first assume that the user has a good internet connection. But if the connection is slow or doesn't work, the service worker helps the website keep working by using saved (cached) data.
For example, if a page can't load something from the internet, the service worker can show an older version that was saved before. This way, users can still use the website, even without internet or with a weak connection.
In short, service workers help websites work smoothly in bad conditions instead of just breaking.
